# Running

You can run the development server while working on it, and then the build script if for some reason you had to modify files in the `cli` folder.

## dev

To run the development server, you can just use its own CLI:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

If you modify files inside the `webpack` folder, you need to restart the server.

## build

To build the CLI, you can run the following:

```bash
$ yarn build:cli
```

It will just compile the files in the `cli` folder with babel, putting the compiled files in the `bin` folder.
