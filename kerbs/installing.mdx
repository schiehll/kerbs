# Installing

First make sure you have <Link to="nodejs">node</Link> installed.

Once you have it in place, clone the <Link to="github" href="https://github.com/schiehll/kerbs">project repositoty</Link> and install its dependencies.

To install the dependencies you should be using <Link to="yarn">yarn</Link> to make use of our `yarn.lock` file, running the following command on your terminal:

```bash
$ yarn install
```
