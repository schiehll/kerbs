> Onboard new devs into your project

Sometimes you are not the one starting the project from scratch, and it takes some time to understand how everything is glued together and all the reasoning behind the decisions made by the ones before you.

If you ever took some time to get back to your own sideproject you know that even the projects you started doesn't make much sense after a while.
